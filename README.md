## Probelm
 
While physical activity is a massive $264.6 billion commercial segment in the US, there is a major divide because the US ranks 20th in physical activity participation comprising only 58 percent of Americans.Inaccessibility, time constraints, privacy, etc. are major hurdles against the desire to maintain fitness and general health among the people.Current fitness applications pose a problem of inconvenience in real-time posture tracking and feedback. Also, the on-demand video content doesnâ€™t actually give you a personalized experience and the online trainer costs are quite expensive.The need for an affordable, remote, and intelligent fitness application seems to be very  eminent.
